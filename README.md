Dear,

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test site https://reqres.in.
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server https://reqres.in.

10 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 1.333 And Total Concurrent API requested: 80.

50 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 6.67 And Total Concurrent API requested: 400.

100 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 13.3 And Total Concurrent API requested: 800.

150 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 20 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1200.

- While executed 100 concurrent request, found  1 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.08%.
Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 800 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
